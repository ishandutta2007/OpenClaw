🦞 **FasterClaw** is a new, ultra-lightweight version of the original OpenClaw, rewritten from the ground up in Go. It's designed for extreme efficiency, making it significantly **faster** and capable of running on low-cost hardware. It's a faster version of OpenClaw, offering a 99% reduction in memory usage and a 400x faster startup time.

From clearing your inbox and scheduling meetings to checking you in for flights, summarizing documents, running terminal commands, controlling smart devices, pushing code, or even building new skills autonomously — FasterClaw turns natural language into real-world action.

Fully **open-source**, privacy-first, runs locally on your hardware (Mac, Linux, Windows, Raspberry Pi, VPS), bring-your-own-LLM (Claude, GPT, local models & more). No subscriptions, no cloud lock-in.

## Why FasterClaw?

While OpenClaw is powerful, FasterClaw focuses on speed and efficiency.

- 🪶 **Ultra-lightweight**: Less than 10MB memory footprint — 99% smaller than OpenClaw.
- 💰 **Minimal Cost**: Runs on $10 hardware — 98% cheaper than a Mac mini.
- ⚡️ **Blazing Fast**: 400x faster startup time, booting in under a second on a single 0.6GHz core.
- 🌍 **Truly Portable**: Single binary for RISC-V, ARM, and x86.
- 🤖 **AI-Bootstrapped**: The Go implementation was autonomously generated by an AI agent.

## Key Features

- 🎯 **Autonomous Task Execution** — send emails, manage calendar, book flights, research, automate workflows  
- 🧠 **Persistent Long-Term Memory** — remembers preferences, context, history across all sessions  
- 💬 **Multi-Channel Access** — chat via WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, Signal & more  
- 🔧 **Tool & Skill System** — extensible via plugins/skills (email, files, browser, terminal, smart home…)  
- ⚡ **Proactive Behavior** — heartbeat system notifies you of important events automatically  
- 🛡️ **Self-Hosted & Private** — runs on your machine, no data leaves unless you allow it  
- 🤖 **Bring Your Own Model** — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama, Mistral, local LLMs…  
- 🔄 **Self-Extending** — can write & install new code/skills to solve novel problems  

## How It Works

1. **Gateway** — local control plane routes messages, manages sessions & memory  
2. **LLM Brain** — powerful model (e.g. Claude Opus/Sonnet) reasons & plans  
3. **Tools & Skills** — execute actions (read/write files, send messages, run commands…)  
4. **Channels** — talk to your assistant from any supported messaging app  
5. **Heartbeat** — periodic proactive checks & notifications  

Your assistant lives 24/7 on your hardware, always ready, always remembering.
